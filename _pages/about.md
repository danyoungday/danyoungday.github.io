Hi, I'm Daniel Young, an incoming Ph.D. student at the University of Texas at Austin (ðŸ¤ž), and it has always been my dream to have a fun Ph.D. student webpage.

I'm interested in artificial intelligence and neural networks, more specifically in using them to aid and augment human decision making.
